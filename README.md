## mmm yes here is the tada todo tootoo list: ##


### visuals ### 
(I've recently learned how to make good-ish dynamic backgrounds so I am going to pass the knowledge onto you and make something that will resemble the music video :troll:)

At beat 68 (my brandmy bradmybrand) on the slider part, we could put like a zoom effect or something like that, or maybe "stop" the notes, so the notes stops moving visually but they are actually keep moving

And probably the same stopping thing at the beat 100, until 115

And 340-355

At 468 (omg my brand again omgomgomg) you could probably put the effect at the beggining, when the playfield spins before the 2 sliders, but reverse, and maybe a bit slow

### mods ### 
duh (I have a good idea of what to do and now the thing would be actually making the ideas)
I remember you talking about how you don't know what else to mod so maybe add lasers to other parts of the song
slumpage?????^667^^56554454545I had ideas for a harder chart so maybe

### dont know how to call this lol ###
~~don't remember anything else for now but will probably add things here later~~
